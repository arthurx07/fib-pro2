## X34075, Arbre d'avaluacións d'expressió booleana
Easy tree recursion exercise, with taking account of lower branches, done in
15min.
## X90041, Estudiants que s'inscriuen en assignatures
Easy exercise, but with the added difficulty it has to be done using two map<string, set<string>>,
as the can ask you to search with the key or the value. So we have one key->value map, and another value->key map.
*I don't think this is the best method to do it*.
Done in 20min.
